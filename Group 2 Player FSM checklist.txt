Checklist for player FSM:
1)	Make sure that the player only moves on initial button press
2)	Make sure that the player FSM doesnt update values while we a drawing a frame.
3)	Optionally add a feature where if the player is holding down a directional button,
	to read the input every x number of frames.
4)	Have comments for each state describing the function of the state.
5)	Make sure that if you press two or more buttons on the same frame that nothing happens
	instead of one button taking priority with the exception of the mining button and one directional button.
6)	Make sure to check energy level in the mine central state.
7)	Use defined values for energy cost, so that it is easy to change into a signal if we add a shop.
